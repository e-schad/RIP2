The thing is, Nick has been seeing the devil. For months, he'd been telling anyone who would listen that there was someone, or something lurking out in the woods behind the bar. At first, everyone assumed he was just exaggerating for the sake of a good story. Nick would spend the whole night in a corner booth, spinning yarns, and telling tales. But there was no way he could be making up the creepiness he was getting, or the dead animals on his doorstep, or the fires that kept flaring up near the building. He had no reason to, not when thing were getting so dangerous. Someone was trying to scare him, maybe even scare him to death. He was obsessed with figuring out who was to blame. He'd stay in the bar office for hours, pouring over the security camera footage, and scribbling notes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;On the night he died, I'd just closed up when he came out of the office, and said he'd finally figured it out. Before he could explain, he saw someone outside, and ran off into the woods. My back was to the door, and so I didn't see anybody. By the time I turned around, both Nick and the devil were gone. And all that was left was a small fire burning outside. After I put it out, I waited for Nick, but he never came back. I can't help wondering what he would have told me if he had the chance. After his death was ruled an accident, I went through, and found all the notes he'd been keeping about the devil, in a locked up deposit bag. I still haven't figured out how to open it. I even found proof that the devil was real, finally caught on camera, like Nick had been trying to do for months.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Having the evidence, I phoned the Sheriff, hoping it would change his mind. But he didn't care that Nick really was chasing after someone that night. The official determination is still that the authorities\u2026I think I slipped up. Yeah, the official determination is that Nick slipped, and fell off the cliff. But the thing is, I went out to the place where he died, and I didn't, and I don't think the authorities even bothered to look any further than the spot where they found Nick's body. There was caution tape down the rocks, but nothing up on top of the cliff. The ground near the ledge didn't look like it had been disturbed since that Friday night, Saturday night. And if the authorities had been there, there's no way they'd count out foul play.<br>&nbsp;Somebody in a devil mask really was there that night. And whoever it was pushed Nick off that cliff. The Sheriff may not believe me, but I must be making someone nervous by looking into Nick's death. I've started to get threatening letters, just like the ones Nick was getting before he died. I'd be lying if I said that I'm not scared, but those threats also prove I'm onto something, don't you think? I know I'm close, but I've still got questions that I can't answer. I'm sending you all the evidence I've collected in the hopes that you'll be able to do what I can't, and bring my friend's killer to justice before it's too late.&nbsp;<br>","OVA":{"firstname":"Anon","surname":"User","url":"","nodes":[],"edges":[]}}
