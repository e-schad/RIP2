Old Scratch owner's death ruled an accident, a tragic end to a difficult year, by Mitsy Sutherland. But may be pretended. The Perdition Sheriff's Office announced on Monday that it has ruled the death of Old Scratch Tavern owner, Nicholas Webster, an accident. According to Sheriff Paul McGinty, Webster fell to his death in the early hours of Saturday morning, likely minutes after leaving Old Scratch Tavern. It was dark, and unfortunately Nick just lost his footing, McGinty said at the press conference, Monday morning. A neighbour discovered Webster's remains at the bottom of Devil's Well\u2026oh\u2026a local waterfall, early Saturday morning. This is not the first misfortune to befall Webster, and his tavern, in recent months. In July, Webster told this paper, nothing valuable was stolen following a series of petty burglaries, but said he was taking measures to ensure that incidents did not continue.<br>&nbsp;Sheriff McGinty confirmed that no perpetrator was apprehended for the thefts. More recently, Webster had reported a series of small fires, and other disturbances at the bar. Official records show that Webster called Perdition Emergency Services ten times between September 1st, and December 7th. Carmen Rojas, a bartender at Old Scratch said Webster feared someone was out to get him, though she did not know who might have wanted to harm her employer. The circumstances of Webster's death led to some Perdition residents, including Rojas, to speculate whether this fall might not have been accidental. However, Sheriff McGinty was adamant these claims are groundless. I'm sure my Deputy would have discovered any signs of foul play, he said. We are looking at someone who was a little worked-up, who had a drink or two.<br>&nbsp;It's tragic, but accidents happen. Webster's widow, Cherie said in a statement, I have faith in the Sheriff's Office, and I'm so grateful for their help. Nick was the love of my life, and I don't know what I'll do without him. Mrs Webster did not address whether Old Scratch Tavern will reopen, but Perdition's residents will surely miss their favourite neighbourhood barkeep. Carol Neubauer, a member of the Perdition Billiards Club said, Old Scratch's pool championship won't be the same without Nick cheering us on. [00:12:40] Donna Goddard, a long time patron of Webster's bar said, it's heartbreaking, Nick made the best old-fashioned in town, and I know I won't be the only person having one in his honour tonight.&nbsp;<br>","OVA":{"firstname":"Anon","surname":"User","url":"","nodes":[],"edges":[]}}
