Hello, Investigator, I'm so glad you've joined Gray Investigations. I'm excited to be mentoring a new member of our investigative team, and I'll trust you're up to the challenge of solving this crime. Your client, Carmen, was struggling to get anyone to listen to her before she came to us. I don't know what the local authorities were thinking when they ruled Nick Webster's death an accident. As soon as I took a look, I knew she was onto something, she's no doubt, there's no doubt in my mind, Nick Webster was murdered, it's just a matter of figuring out who killed him. Do you want to read the next one?\n[00:01:24] Participant 5: Yeah, sure. So, Carmen's already managed to identify four clear suspects, each of them more than capable of committing the crime. As you're working this case, pay attention to your suspect's means, motive, and opportunity, only a combination of all three will reveal the killer. When it comes to alibis, you should be able to corroborate\u2026collaborate?\n[00:01:50] Participant 6: Corroborate?\n[00:01:50] Participant 5: \u2026is it supposed to be collaborate?\n[00:01:51] Researcher 1: I think, corroborate, yeah.\n[00:01:52] Participant 6: Corroborate.\n[00:01:53] Participant 5: Corroborate everyone's whereabouts at the time of the murder. Anyone who can prove they weren't at the scenes of the crime is probably in the clear, but it's not enough to simply exclude in the same suspects. To truly crack this case, you will need to work out who the real criminal is, and why they committed the crime. I'm enclosing all of the evidence Carmen sent. As you review her notes remember a good investigator never takes a suspect at their word. You should always be able to find information that confirms, or contradicts someone's claim. Do you want to read the next bit?\n[00:02:27] Participant 4: Sure, yeah. \n[00:02:27] Participant 5: Okay.","OVA":{"firstname":"Rebecca","surname":"Raddatz","url":"","nodes":[],"edges":[]}}
