Should I read it out? \n \"Dear Miss Grey, I'm writing because I think my boss was murdered, but I can't prove it on my own. I'm hoping someone at Grey Investigations can help me.\" So, it's only the introduction. \n \"Let me give you a little background, I learned everything I know,\" so I'm writing the first paragraph, introduction. \n Now looking at the second\u2026 \"I learned everything I know about bartending from my boss, Nick Webster. He taught me how to pull a perfect pint and coached me on 86ing rowdy patrons. He even helped me rearrange my work schedule so I could be [00:06:00] home more when my sister was sick last year, Nick was the best.

Fourth\u2026\n \"The thing is Nick had been seeing the devil. For months, he had been telling anyone who would listen that there was someone or something lurking out in the woods behind the bar.\" So, now I'm writing from here the first he was telling about the woods behind the bar. How are you comfortable? Should I read one like this slowly? \n[00:07:59] Participant 32: [00:08:00] Yes, it's okay. ","OVA":{"firstname":"Anon","surname":"User","url":"","nodes":[],"edges":[]}}
