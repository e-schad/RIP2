Carmen has already managed to identify four clear suspects, each of them are capable of committing the crime. As you're working this case, pay attention to your suspects' means, motives, and opportunity, only a combination of all three will reveal the killer. When it comes to alibis, you should be able to correlate everyone's whereabouts at the time of the murder. Anyone who can prove they weren't at the scene of the crime is probably in the clear, but it is not enough to simply exclude innocent suspects. \nTo truly crack the case, you'll need to work out who the real criminal is, and why they committed the crime. I'm enclosing all of the evidence Carmen sent us, as you review her notes, remember a good investigator never takes a suspect at their word. You should always be able to find the information that confirms, or contradicts someone's claims. Oh, and I should warn you, a little familiarity with code-breaking \u2013 well, probably not \u2013 a little familiarity with code-breaking often comes in handy in cases like this, but not for this. \n[00:02:10] Participant 36: Yeah.\n[00:02:10] Participant 34: Unsurprisingly, people with something to hide often use whatever methods they can to conceal their true intentions. I've had to familiarise myself with a lot of different varieties of cryptic communication over the years, but I've left you with an example of one of the most common types of codes I've encountered to help you get up to speed. But don't forget, once you understand the principle, there are lots of different ways to apply the theory. So, I assume all that, we can ignore.&nbsp;<div>[00:02:31] Researcher 2: Yeah.\n[00:02:32] Participant 36: Uh-huh.</div>","OVA":{"firstname":"Anon","surname":"User","url":"","nodes":[],"edges":[]}}
