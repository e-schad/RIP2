So, [Gray] Investigations. 'Hello investigator. I'm so glad you've joined Gray Investigations. I'm excited to be mentoring a new member of our investigative team, and I trust you're up to the challenge of solving this crime.&nbsp;<br>'Your client, Carmen, was struggling to get anyone to listen to her before she came to us. I don't know what the local authorities were thinking when they ruled Nick Webster's death as an accident. As soon as I took a look, I knew she was onto something. There's no doubt in my mind that Nick Webster was murdered, it's just a matter of figuring out who killed him.&nbsp;<br>'Carmen's already managed to identify four clear suspects, each of them more than capable of committing the crime. As you're working this case, pay attention to your suspects' means, motive and opportunity. Only a combination of all three will reveal the killer.<br>'When it comes to alibis, you should be able to corroborate everyone's whereabouts at the time of the murder'. Anyone who can't prove that they were at the\u2026 'Anyone who can prove they weren't at the scene of the crime is probably in the clear. But it's not enough to simply exclude innocent suspects, to truly crack this case, you will need to work out who the real criminal is and why they committed the crime.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;'I'm including all the evidence Carmen sent. As you review her notes, remember a good investigator never takes a suspect at their word. You should always be able to find information that confirms or contradicts someone's claims.&nbsp;<br>'Oh, and I should warn you, a little familiarity with codebreaking often comes in handy in cases like these. Unsurprisingly, people with something to hide often use whatever methods they can to conceal their true intentions. I've had to familiarise myself with a lot of different varieties of cryptic communication over the years. I've left you with an example of one of the most common types of code I've encountered to help you get up to speed. But don't forget, once you understand the principle, there's lots of different ways to apply the theory.&nbsp;<br>'Alright, I think I've given you all the advice I can, you should have what you need to find the killer if you're able to interpret the evidence. Good luck, Michelle Gray'.<br>","OVA":{"firstname":"Anon","surname":"User","url":"","nodes":[],"edges":[]}}
